### Hi there! 👋

I'm Siddharth, a passionate software engineer on a never-ending quest for knowledge and innovation. Currently pursuing my Master of Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, I'm exploring the fascinating realms of software architecture, software project management, and distributed systems. 🎓

During my professional ventures, I had the opportunity to contribute my skills at EIG - Endurance International Group and Mu Sigma. At EIG, I dived into the world of data engineering, building robust pipelines, and orchestrating large-scale data migrations. Working as a decision scientist at Mu Sigma, I leveraged machine learning and full-stack development to create impactful solutions for nuclear power plants and facilitate real-time data-driven decision-making. 🚀

At CMU, as a tech lead of my program's capstone project, I'm responsible for selecting the tech stack based on technical and business constraints and setting up CI/CD, and conducting code reviews. We're building an IDE for Analog Machine Learning chip designers using Rust/Tauri and ReactJS. Some other notable projects I've worked on in the past include a high-performance memory allocator, an exciting real-time chess web application, and a text-mining solution for customer support optimization. These experiences have sharpened my skills in a gamut of software engineering scenarios - from low-level Assembly to the Web, all the way to large-scale data-intensive applications. 💻

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I derive immense joy from competing in Coding Competitions and problem-solving in general. I really like algorithmic puzzles and chess. I've also had the honor of representing my institute at the prestigious ACM ICPC Regional Contests twice. 🏆

If you're interested in discussing software engineering, exploring new projects, chess, language acquisition (currently learning `ES` 🇪🇸) or simply having a friendly conversation, feel free to reach out! Let's connect and embark on an exciting journey together. ✨
